# Outline Eclipsed

_Outline Eclipsed_: An outline view for VS Code that lets you drag and drop to reorganize your document structure.

ü™ê A VS Code extension that provides an interactive outline tree view for markdown files. Inspired by the Eclipse IDE, Outline Eclipsed lets you reorder sections by dragging and dropping headings.

üí° Reorganizing long documents is tedious. Instead of cutting and pasting text blocks, just drag headings in the tree view. Nested sections move together automatically. The editor highlights and scrolls to show exactly what moved. You stay focused on structure, not on selecting text ranges.

‚è© Install from the VS Code Marketplace and open any markdown file. The "Outline Eclipsed" view appears in the Explorer sidebar. Click headings to navigate. Drag them to reorganize.

### Features

- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Drag headings to reorder sections. Nested headings move with their parent automatically.
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Click a heading to jump to that section. Move your cursor, and the tree highlights the current heading.
- **Visual Feedback**: After dragging, the editor auto-scrolls and highlights the moved section for 3 seconds.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The tree refreshes automatically as you edit the document.
- **Hierarchical View**: See your document structure at a glance with expandable/collapsible nested headings.

### Installation

```bash
# Via VS Code Marketplace
ext install douglashellinger.outline-eclipsed
