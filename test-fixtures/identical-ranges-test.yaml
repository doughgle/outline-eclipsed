# Identical Ranges Bug Test File
# This file is used to test the bug where items with identical ranges
# are incorrectly filtered out during multi-select drag operations.

# Test Case 1: Simple sibling keys
# These are at the same level with different ranges
key_a: value_a
key_b: value_b
key_c: value_c

# Test Case 2: Single-line keys that may share identical ranges
# Depending on the YAML language server, these might have the same range
single_line_a: "short"
single_line_b: "short"

# Test Case 3: Parent with children that have similar structure
parent_with_identical_children:
  identical_child_1: value1
  identical_child_2: value2
  identical_child_3: value3

# Test Case 4: Nested structure for verifying proper containment filtering
outer_container:
  middle_layer:
    inner_item: deep_value
  sibling_to_middle:
    another_inner: another_value

# Test Case 5: Edge case - items that could potentially share line ranges
first_item_group:
  sub_a: 1
  sub_b: 2

second_item_group:
  sub_c: 3
  sub_d: 4

# Test Case 6: Multi-select target for drag operations
# Try selecting these in various combinations
target_alpha: alpha_value
target_beta: beta_value
target_gamma: gamma_value
target_delta: delta_value
